**_Journal of Cheminformatics_ will only publish research or software that is entirely reproducible
by third parties. This means that any datasets, software and algorithms that are required to

Research articles should include an abstract that does not exceed 350 words.

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the
reader with a visual description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical
abstract should be 920 x 300 pixels and a maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are
encouraged to make judicious use of colour in graphical abstracts. All graphical abstracts
should have a white background and where possible should fill the available width.

**Citation Typing Ontology pilot**

The _Journal of Cheminformatics_ welcomes authors to participate in our pilot using the Citation Typing Ontology
([http://purl.org/spar/cito](http://purl.org/spar/cito)). For more information, please see
[here](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/c/co/cito).

**FAIR chemical structures**

Articles discussing chemical structures, computed or with experimental data, should include
a document in the Additional files with machine readable information about those chemicals,
as explained in [this paper](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-021-00520-4).
