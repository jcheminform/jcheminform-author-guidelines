Research articles should include an abstract that does not exceed 350 words.

The abstract should contain a heading called `Contribution`, under which you should specifically explain what the contribution of the article is, over and above prior work on the topic. While the journal does not overly index on novelty, it is beneficial to the readers to easily understand the specific contributions of the article to the field

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the
reader with a visual description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical
abstract should be 920 x 300 pixels and a maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are
encouraged to make judicious use of colour in graphical abstracts. All graphical abstracts
should have a white background and where possible should fill the available width.
