A Data Note should describe a curated, Public Domain, CCZero or CC-BY-licensed dataset (explicit statement is
required), and likely to be of broad utility. The dataset must
be curated as detailed in this publication and archived for long-term reuse. A Data Note must describe the content
of the data set, the method used to curate the data, and a description of how the dataset deposition complies with
the [FAIR principles](https://doi.org/10.1162/DINT_R_00024). Unlike a Database paper, Data Notes focus on the
data itself and not on how the data can be graphically or otherwise explored.

The structure of a Data Notes paper should include the following components:

* an abstract that does not exceed 350 words
* an Objective section
* a Data description, with two subsections called Curation and FAIR-ification
* a Limitations section
* followed by the common sections Abbreviations, Declarations, and References

The main section of the article starts with an Objective section explaining where the data came
from and why it was collected citing a selection of relevant literature, particularly articles describing
data (re)used in this article, and how this data is or can be used. The Limitations section should
discuss the limitations of the data to help the reader to assess the reusability. When your
data is collected from other data, adhere to the [DataCite](https://datacite.org/cite-your-data.html) principles
(and please use *[cito:usesDataFrom]*, see the Citation Typing Ontology section below).

The Data description should contain a table describing the data files presented in this publication
in a general paragraph, followed by at least two subsections describing the methodologies used to curate the data
(in the "Curation" subsection) and to make the data FAIR (in the "FAIR-ification" subsection).
The Curation section must describe how the data was curated and include a qualitative or quantitative
characterization of how the data was improved this way.

The FAIR-ification section must describe for all FAIR Guiding Principles what
choices were made for the presented data, citing appropriate literature. For example, describe
where (meta)data is made findable, what globally unique persistent identifiers are used, such as the
InChI for chemical structures, and what open standards or ontologies are used in the dataset.
Of particular interest is the domain-specific community standards employed in the dataset. This
can include applied minimal reporting standards. A summary of this can be provided as a table.
