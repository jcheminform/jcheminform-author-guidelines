Methodologies should present a new computational method, test or procedure. The method described may either be completely new, or may offer a better version of an existing method. If the latter, the article must describe a demonstrable advance on what is currently available. The method needs to have been well tested using appropriate validation methods (for example, by comparison to a null model, using appropriate statistics and so on). Ideally, experimental validation of the computational method should be provided, but this is not a requirement.

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the reader with a visual
description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical abstract should be 920 x 300 pixels and a
maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are encouraged to make judicious use of colour in graphical abstracts.
All graphical abstracts should have a white background and where possible should fill the available width.
